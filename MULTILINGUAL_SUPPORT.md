# Multilingual Support Implementation

## Implementation Status

The multilingual support has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Language Files
- Created base language files for English (`en`)
- Created base language files for Arabic (`ar`)
- Files include:
  - `auth.php`: Authentication messages
  - `pagination.php`: Pagination messages
  - `passwords.php`: Password reset messages
  - `validation.php`: Form validation messages
  - `app.php`: Application-specific terminology and labels

### Language Switching Infrastructure
- Created `LanguageSwitcher` middleware to handle language switching
- Added middleware to `Kernel.php`
- Created `LanguageController` for language switching functionality
- Added language switching route in `web.php`

### Helper Functions
Added several helper functions to `GlobalFunctions.php`:
- `getCurrentLanguage()`: Get current application language
- `isRtl()`: Check if current language is RTL (Right-to-Left)
- `getLanguageDirection()`: Get HTML direction attribute
- `getAvailableLanguages()`: Get list of available languages

### RTL Support
- Created RTL CSS file for Arabic layout support
- Added RTL direction to HTML tag based on current language

### UI Components
- Added language switcher component in the application layout
- Implemented both Arabic and English UI labels through translation files

### Service Provider
- Created `LanguageServiceProvider` to share language variables with views
- Registered provider in `config/app.php`

### To Do
- Update all hardcoded texts in views to use translation syntax (`__('app.key')`)
- Add more language-specific terms in the app.php files
- Create additional language files for specific features (e.g., `booking.php`, `tickets.php`)

## Usage Examples

### In Blade Templates
```php
{{ __('app.home') }} // Will output "Home" in English or "الرئيسية" in Arabic
```

### Checking for RTL
```php
@if(isRtl())
    <!-- RTL specific markup -->
@else
    <!-- LTR specific markup -->
@endif
```

### Direction Attribute
```html
<div dir="{{ getLanguageDirection() }}">
    <!-- Content that respects text direction -->
</div>
```

### Language Switching
Users can switch between languages using the language switcher component in the application header.
