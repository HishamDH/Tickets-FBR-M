### Summary of Completed Work

Since the initial audit, significant progress has been made in establishing the core data structures and implementing key functionalities:

*   **Database Schema Foundation:**
    *   `branches`, `categories`, `carts`, `merchant_wallets` tables and models created.
    *   `paid_reservations` table updated with a `status` column.
    *   `User` model updated with `branches()`, `wallet()`, and `carts()` relationships.
    *   `PaidReservation` model updated to correctly handle `status` and `additional_data`.

*   **Core Feature Implementations:**
    *   **Branch Management (Filament Resource):** Admin/Merchant UI for managing branches, with multi-tenancy scoping.
    *   **Category Management (Filament Resource):** Admin UI for managing categories, including automatic slug generation.
    *   **Merchant Wallet Management (Filament Resource):** Admin UI for viewing/editing merchant balances.
    *   **Automated Wallet Creation:** `UserObserver` ensures new merchants get a wallet upon registration.
    *   **Shopping Cart System:**
        *   `CartService` for cart logic (add, remove, clear, total).
        *   `CartComponent` (Livewire) for cart display and interaction.
        *   `AddToCartButton` (Livewire) for adding items to cart from service pages.
        *   `/cart` route and view.
    *   **Checkout Process (Placeholder Payment):**
        *   `CheckoutService` for order placement and payment initiation.
        *   `CheckoutComponent` (Livewire) for checkout form and order summary.
        *   `/checkout` route and view.
        *   `/checkout/confirmation` route and view.
        *   `PaymentController` and `/payment/callback` route for handling payment gateway responses (placeholder logic).

*   **Database Seeding:**
    *   `CategorySeeder` created and integrated.
    *   `OfferingFactory` created and integrated.
    *   `UserFactory` and `DatabaseSeeder` corrected to properly seed `name`, `f_name`, and `l_name` for users.
    *   The database can now be successfully seeded with sample data using `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.

*   **UI Integration:**
    *   "Cart" link added to the main navigation.
    *   "Add to Cart" button integrated into the service detail page.

### Remaining Gaps & Discrepancies (Updated Audit)

While significant progress has been made, the project still has areas that require further development to achieve full compliance with the `ROADMAP.md` and the reference project:

*   **File Structure Discrepancies (from reference project):**
    *   `app/Actions`, `app/Helpers`, `app/Jobs` directories are still missing.
    *   The root-level `lang` directory is missing.
    *   Role-specific route files (`admin.php`, `merchant.php`, `user.php`) are not implemented, leading to a consolidated `web.php`.
    *   `resources/views/customer` and `resources/views/merchant` dashboard view folders (as per reference project's structure) are not fully replicated.

*   **Database Schema Gaps (from roadmap/reference):**
    *   Migrations for: `pays_histories`, `supports`, `support_chats`, `merchant_withdraws`, `withdraw_logs`, `page_views`, `merchant_chats`, `merchant_messages`, `setups`, `presences` tables are still missing.

*   **Core Feature Gaps (from roadmap):**
    *   **Full Payment Gateway Integration:** The current implementation is a placeholder. Actual integration with `ticket-window.ottu.com` API is required (sending real requests, handling real responses, signature verification).
    *   **Merchant Dashboard Features:** Beyond branch management, many features listed in the roadmap for merchants (POS, statistics, customer reviews, message center, team management, page setup, policies settings) are not implemented.
    *   **Customer Dashboard Features:** Beyond cart/checkout, many features listed for customers (tickets, pay history, profile management, support, rewards, experiences) are not implemented.
    *   **Admin Dashboard Features:** Many specific admin features (reports, user management beyond basic Filament, withdrawals management) are not implemented.
    *   **Authentication Guards:** While the `User` model has `user_type`, the `config/auth.php` configuration might need explicit guards for `admin`, `merchant`, `customer` as per the roadmap.
    *   **Offerings vs. Services:** The project uses both `Service` and `Offering` models. The cart/checkout is tied to `Offering`. Clarification/unification might be needed if `Service` is also a purchasable item.

*   **Known Issues/Warnings:**
    *   The payment gateway integration is a placeholder and requires actual API implementation.
    *   The `Service` and `Offering` models might need clarification or unification if both are intended to be purchasable.

### Required Files/Components for Completion

To fully align the project with the `ROADMAP.md` and the reference, the following components need to be created or modified:

*   **Database:**
    *   Migrations for all missing tables listed above.
*   **Backend Logic (`app` directory):**
    *   Implement `app/Actions`, `app/Helpers`, `app/Jobs` as per reference project's patterns.
    *   Controllers for specific dashboard features (e.g., `MerchantDashboardController` methods for POS, analytics, etc.; `CustomerDashboardController` methods for tickets, history, etc.).
    *   Services for other complex business logic (e.g., `WithdrawalService`, `ReportService`).
*   **Frontend (Livewire/Filament/Views):**
    *   Filament resources for other admin-managed entities (e.g., `PaymentGateway` settings if not fully covered, `User` management beyond basic).
    *   Livewire components for merchant-specific features (e.g., POS interface, detailed analytics views).
    *   Livewire components for customer-specific features (e.g., ticket display, payment history).
    *   Blade views for all dashboard pages (`resources/views/admin`, `resources/views/merchant`, `resources/views/customer` dashboards).
    *   **Mini-Cart Component:** A Livewire component to display cart item count in the navigation.
*   **Routing:**
    *   Implement role-specific route files (`admin.php`, `merchant.php`, `user.php`) for better organization, if desired.
    *   Flesh out routes for all new features.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Populate `.env` with actual `OTTU_API_KEY` and `OTTU_MERCHANT_ID`.
    *   Review `config/auth.php` for explicit guards if needed.
